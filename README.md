**All About: **Git****
-- 
Have you ever worked hard on a project and forgot to save it? This happens all too often to developers and their teams. Sure, it happens, but what if there was a way to save your code, and be able to reference different versions of the source code? This is what Linus Torvalds and his team experienced when creating the Linux kernel in 2005. The team initially used "BitKeeper" but switched to **Git** after licensing disagreements. Torvalds famously wrote the program in 10 days and preformed his first commit for **Git**... With **Git**!

JetBrains' Webstorm is also a great integrated development environment (IDE) that is designed to support several languages, such as Hypertext Markup language (HTML), Node.js, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and TypeScript, which are more frequented with Front-End development.

First, open your internet browser of choice, and write: 'https://git-scm.com' into the search bar and press the 'enter or 'return' key. Once you reach the website, you'll be greeted with a short description of what Git is and a place to download the latest version. Scroll down, and stop when you see the computer monitor with the download link to for your operating system. The website should automatically recognize what operating system you're working from, so you don't need to look for a specific version.

<ins>*For Linux and Mac Users:*</ins> At this point in the process, you will need an extra tool for **Git** to be able to work on your device. While on the website, open a seperate tab and write 'https://homebrew.sh' in your browser's webpage. Here, you'll be able to download Homebrew, an open-source software package manager for these operating systems that simplifies installation and software management processes. Search for the following script to be able to enter it in your Terminal or shell management app in coordination with your specific Linux distro. 

Once Homebrew is installed, return to your 'https://git-scm.com' tab. Then, click the download button that appears on the image of the computer screen. This will put you on a page that shows you the script to download **Git**. Here, you'll need to return to your Terminal, or your shell management system. Copy and paste the script from the website and enter it into the shell. Press the 'Enter' or 'Return' key and wait until the installation process is complete. 

<ins>*For Windows Users:*</ins> You may skip the Hombrew installation and proceed with downloading **Git** directly from the website. Once downloaded, open the .exe file and continue along the set up process that will include where you want **Git** to stay on your device, which IDE you will be able to use Git in, and the licensing agreement. 

To check if you have the latest version of **Git**, enter or copy and past the following script into the Terminal or shell management system: 'git --version'

Congratulations! You now have **Git** installed to your device.

7. *Fetch:* Downloads objects and tags from another repository.
   
9. *Git:* An app dedicated to the version control of source code files.
    
11. *Github:* "A web-based interfaced that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple that lets multiple people make seperate changes to web pages at the same time." It also allows developers to create, store and manage and share their code.
    
13. *Merge:* A **merge** allows the developer to join two different forked histories together again.
    
15. *Merge Conflict:* A system error that occurs when more than one file changes are made to the same line of code, or section of a file. **Git** can't automatically decide which changes to keep and which to discard.
    
16. *Push:* The **push** command uploads the data content from a local repository to a remote repository, like **Github**.
    
17. *Pull:*

18. *Remote:*
